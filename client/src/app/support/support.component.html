            Our primary purpose is the promotion and development 
            of youth Gaelic games in our area. Our programs are 
            run entirely by volunteers. We are 501(c)(3) non-profit

        <h2>Sponsorship</h2>
        <p>
            While our programs are expanding considerably this year, 
            we intend to keep the registration fees for the kids to 
            a minimum. This is to make our programs accessible to as 
            many kids as possible and to encourage new kids to try 
            out Gaelic football. If you are aware of any businesses 
            or organizations that may be interested in sponsorship, 
            please ask them to contact us at detroitharps@gmail.com

        <h2>Volunteer</h2>
        <p>
            We are always in need of volunteers. Please consider volunteering. 
            We need help with various aspects of the administration of the 
            club and with coaching and referees for our summer league. There 
            is no experience with Gaelic football required to help with coaching. 
            Also we will be hosting a free 1-day foundation coaching course in 
            the spring of 2016 for all coaches in our club. More details will 
            follow.
