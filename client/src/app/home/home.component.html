    <h1>The Detroit Harps Gaelic Football Club</h1>
    <p>
        Our summer program in Canton has now been formally named the 
        Detroit Harps Gaelic Football Club. We chose the Harp as our 
        club name as it has been a national symbol of Ireland for 
        hundreds of years. Our Football program is open to ages 5-14. 
        Beginning in 2016 we will have a local 7-a-side league 
        established for each age group and will be organizing games 
        and tournaments against other Midwest clubs. New players are 
        always welcome. Experience with Gaelic Football is not 
        required. Through the generosity of our sponsors, club supporters 
        and volunteers, we are able to keep the cost of our program to 
        minimal fee. Our goal is to encourage as many kids as possible 
        to try out this exciting sport. For any question or further 
        information, please see our Contact page.
