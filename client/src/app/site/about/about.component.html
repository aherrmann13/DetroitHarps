        <h2>Gaelic Football</h2>
        <p>
            Gaelic Football is a field game which has developed as a distinct game 
            similar to the progression of Australian Rules. Gaelic Football is 
            played on a pitch up to 145m long and 90m wide. The goalposts are the 
            same shape as on a rugby pitch, with the crossbar lower than a rugby one 
            and slightly higher than a soccer one.
            <br />
            <br />
            The ball used in Gaelic Football is round, slightly smaller than a soccer 
            ball. It can be carried in the hand for a distance of four steps and can 
            be kicked or "hand-passed", a striking motion with the hand or fist. After 
            every four steps the ball must be either bounced or "solo-ed", an action 
            of dropping the ball onto the foot and kicking it back into the hand. You 
            may not bounce the ball twice in a row.
            <br />
            <br />
            To score, you put the ball over the crossbar by foot or hand / fist for one 
            point or under the crossbar and into the net by foot or the hand / fist in 
            certain circumstances for a goal, the latter being the equivalent of three 
            points. Each team consists of 15 players, lining out as per the diagram.
            <br />
            <br />
            Officials for a game comprise of a referee, two linesmen (to indicate when 
            the ball leaves the field of play at the side and to mark '45â€™ free kicks) 
            and four umpires (to signal scores, assist the referee in controlling the 
            games, and to assist linesmen in positioning '45' frees).
            <br />
            <br />
            A goal is signalled by raising a green flag, placed to the left of the goal. 
            A point is signalled by raising a white flag, placed to the right of goal. 
            A '45' is signalled by the umpire raising his/her outside arm. A 'square ball', 
            when a player scores having arrived in the 'square' prior to receiving the 
            ball, is signalled by pointing at the small parallelogram.
